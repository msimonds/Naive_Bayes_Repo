This code was written by Michael Simonds and Rachel Katz.

It is a python program which can predict the author of an unknown passage of text. To accomplish this
our program takes in a training list - a set of texts written by various authors - and then uses 
a Naive Bayes approach to calculate the probability that the text is written by an author based off 
of the series of words it has seen.
